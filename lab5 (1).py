def findWords(tweets, keyWords):

    Parameters:
    - tweets: dictionary with {username: ListOfTweets} where each 
        username is a string, and the ListOfTweets  is a list 
        of strings representing tweets
    - keyLetters: list of words 

    Returns: A dictionary

    Function counts the number of occurences of a word in all the tweets

    Assume there are repeats of words, so just using **in** will not work. You will have to check if the word is within a word

    You will have to use the function split, which is done on a string. 
    Do not worry about special characters, ".", "'", "," and such.
